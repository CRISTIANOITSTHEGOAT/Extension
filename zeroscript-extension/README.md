# ZeroScript Free - AI Roblox Studio Agent (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena, Meta AI)

Control Roblox Studio with AI, for free. ZeroScript turns a normal AI chat (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Google Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena, or Meta AI) into an agent that builds and scripts your Roblox game for you: just describe what you want, and it reads/edits scripts, runs Luau, inspects the game tree, and generates assets directly in Roblox Studio. No API key, no terminal, no coding required.

It's a Chrome/Edge browser extension plus a small local bridge that connects the chat to Roblox Studio through the official MCP server. **DeepSeek is the recommended provider.** ChatGPT, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen, Arena and Meta AI also work. On ChatGPT, screenshots and image input are disabled on purpose (its free tier caps files/images on a separate quota from messages, so vision would only work part of the day); ChatGPT also summarises its own context in long sessions, so ZeroScript re-states its operating instructions periodically (shown as a "Reminder" chip) to stop it forgetting it can run commands. Gemini and Kimi can be less stable: Gemini tends to stop using the Roblox tools in long sessions, and Kimi sometimes reaches for its own native tools instead of the Roblox commands. On Arena, keep the mode dropdown on **Direct** (ZeroScript only supports Direct mode).

## Setup

**Load the extension manually (Edge or Chrome):**
1. Go to `edge://extensions` (Edge) or `chrome://extensions` (Chrome)
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `zeroscript-extension` folder
5. The extension is now active

**Then set up the Bridge:**
1. **Download the Bridge** from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/sebattfg/ZeroScript-Free)
2. **Open Roblox Studio** and load a Place
3. **Enable the MCP server in Roblox Studio** (first time only): click **Assistant AI** in the top bar, then **...** > **Manage MCP Servers** > **Enable Studio as MCP Server**
4. **Run the Bridge** - double-click `start.bat` (Windows) or `MacOS_Start.command` (macOS); a small window opens, the Bridge is running. On macOS, the first launch shows a Gatekeeper warning (normal for any downloaded script): click **Done**, then **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway**.
5. **Go to https://chat.deepseek.com** (recommended), https://chatgpt.com, https://gemini.google.com, https://www.kimi.com, https://chat.z.ai, https://chat.qwen.ai, https://arena.ai (or https://lmarena.ai, the same app under its old name), or https://www.meta.ai, open a new chat (only works on these exact addresses; on Arena use Direct mode)
6. Click **Start session** in the ZeroScript panel
7. Type what you want to build

## Architecture (for contributors)

The extension is split between a provider-agnostic core and per-AI-site providers:

```
core/config.js        system prompt, prompt presets, feedback strings, tool
                      categories                                 (global ZS)
core/parser.js        ZeroScript command parsing - pure string logic   (global ZSParse)
core/main.js          agentic loop, UI, camouflage, session state      (uses ZSProvider)
providers/deepseek.js everything DeepSeek-specific: DOM selectors, generation
                      detection, send mechanics, composer modes…       (global ZSProvider)
providers/gemini.js   same interface for Google Gemini (Angular DOM, Quill
                      composer, code-block masking)                    (global ZSProvider)
providers/kimi.js     same interface for Kimi / Moonshot AI (Vue DOM, Lexical
                      composer, segment-code masking)                  (global ZSProvider)
providers/glm.js      same interface for GLM / Z.ai (Svelte DOM, code-block
                      wrapper masking)                                 (global ZSProvider)
providers/qwen.js     same interface for Qwen / chat.qwen.ai (Vue DOM, network-tap
                      SSE stream, Monaco disposal guard)               (global ZSProvider)
providers/qwen-net.js MAIN-world fetch tap for Qwen SSE stream        (injected by manifest)
providers/chatgpt.js  same interface for ChatGPT / chatgpt.com (React DOM,
                      ProseMirror composer, CodeMirror reply reading) (global ZSProvider)
providers/chatgpt-cm.js MAIN-world CodeMirror tap: republishes each code block's
                      TRUE document (the rendered DOM truncates long
                      lines)                                          (injected by manifest)
providers/arena.js    same interface for Arena / arena.ai and LM Arena / lmarena.ai
                      (React DOM, multi-model playground, A/B-comparison
                      auto-commit, Direct-mode gate, Stop-button end of turn) (global ZSProvider)
providers/meta.js     same interface for Meta AI / meta.ai (React DOM, textarea
                      composer, JSON-viewer + code-collapse masking)   (global ZSProvider)
background.js         WebSocket to the local bridge (provider-agnostic)
```

The other half lives in the Bridge (one folder up): `bridge.py` serves the
extension over a local WebSocket and speaks MCP to Roblox Studio, and
`local_tools.py` is the **ZeroScript Dev Kit** - eight commands the Bridge
implements itself (`project_overview`, `script_write`, `script_verify`,
`luau_check`, `script_history`, `workspace`, `studio_view`, `playtest`) and
advertises beside Studio's tools as a server called `zeroscript`. They keep bulk
data (whole script bodies, trees, Output) on the user's machine and hand the
model a summary, which is most of why a session needs fewer turns.

`PROMPT_PRESETS` in `core/config.js` are ready-made custom prompts. Picking one
in the panel fills the *Custom prompt* textarea (it is not a separate prompt
layer), saves it, and remembers the id in `zsPromptPreset`; editing the text
clears that id, so the dropdown never claims a preset that is no longer there.
`test-devkit.js` holds every preset to the same standard as the system prompt:
each snake_case name in the text must be a command that really exists (checked
against `../local_tools.py`, `TOOL_NOTES` and the Studio MCP surface), the
pipeline order must be right - `script_verify` before `playtest` - and the text
must stay small enough to type into every session.

`core/main.js` never touches the host site's DOM directly - it only calls the
`ZSProvider` interface. To integrate another AI site: write a new
`providers/<site>.js` exporting the same interface, then add its URL pattern to
`manifest.json` (`content_scripts` + `host_permissions`) and to
`PROVIDER_URLS` in `background.js`. No core change required.

**Waiting is the enemy.** The loop never polls a page on a timer: `waitTick()`
in `core/main.js` resolves on the next DOM *change* (a `MutationObserver`, with
the old timeout kept only as a ceiling) and `nextPaint()` resolves after the
next paint (two frames), so "the reply is ready" is noticed the moment it
happens instead of up to 250ms later. The settle window after a finished reply
is `SETTLE_MS` in `core/config.js` (250ms; the Arena provider lowers it to
220ms). A provider that knows the site better than the DOM does can do better
still: Arena shows a **Stop generation** button for the whole generation and
swaps it back the instant the model stops, so `providers/arena.js` treats that
button going away as the end of the turn (after a 60ms beat that covers a
re-render blinking it out for a frame) - and it still waits while the text is
growing, so a blink cannot end a turn early. `runBatch()` sends the read-only
steps of a batch **together** and keeps the writing ones in order, so a batch of
reads is one round trip instead of sixteen.

Smoke tests (plain Node, no dependencies - run them from this directory):

- `node test-parser.js` - the command parser (`core/parser.js`).
- `node test-chatgpt.js` - ChatGPT reply reading (`providers/chatgpt.js`),
  driven against a stub DOM: CodeMirror line joining, the `data-zs-cm`
  MAIN-world tap that long code blocks depend on, and subtree exclusion.
- `node test-batch.js` - the `batch` command: `normalizeBatchSteps` from
  `core/config.js`, plus `runBatch` extracted from `core/main.js` and run for
  real against a stubbed `runTool` (ordering, Stop handling, blocked steps,
  `continue_on_error`, the 16-step cap).
- `node test-devkit.js` - the Dev Kit plumbing on this side: the command
  reference the model reads, the system prompt that teaches the workflow, the
  prompt presets (real command names only, pipeline order, size budget, and the
  menu that offers them), the read-only classification that drives the batch
  hint, and the two lists that must never drift from `../local_tools.py` (the
  tool names, and the server id).
- `node test-popup.js` - the popup's status panel, run against a stub DOM: the
  connectivity dot must never read green because the always-alive Dev Kit
  answers while Roblox Studio is closed.
- `node test-fast.js` - the fast paths, run against a stub DOM with a
  controllable clock: Arena's Stop-button end of turn (including the case where
  the text is still growing), the lmarena.ai route handling, the DOM-change wait
  in `core/main.js` (no flat sleeps), and the parallel read-only batch.

All of them print `PASS`/`FAIL` per case and exit non-zero on failure. The
Bridge and the Dev Kit are covered by Python tests one folder up
(`python -m unittest discover -s tests`).
